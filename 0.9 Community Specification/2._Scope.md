## Scope

[Include a detailed description of this Working Groupsâ€™s Scope.  This Scope is important is it establishes the bounds of each contributor's and licensee's intellectual property commitment. For guidance on drafting an appropriate Scope, you may find [ISO's guidance (see page 5)](https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/archive/pdf/en/how-to-write-standards.pdf "ISO How To Write Standards Guide") helpful.

Any changes of Scope are not retroactive.
