# Community Specification

## What is the Community Specification For?

The Community Specification process is a repository-based approach for creating standards and specifications, such as in a GitHub organization. 

## What is the benefit?

The Commununity Specification allows you to start a specification development effort as easily as an open source project.  The Community Specification incorporates the terms and processes required for standards and specification development. It provides the basis to take your specification to other standards bodies, including international standards bodies, for formal standardization if your community desires to pursue those options.

## Could I just use an open source license for my specifications? Why should I use a specification license?

A primary difference between traditional open source licenses and specification licenes is that open source licenses provide intellectual property terms for a specific implementation within a specific codebase. However, specifications provide a blueprint  developers intend to implement in many different codebases. Specification licenses are designed to provide intellectual property terms for independent implementations of the specification. Because of this, if you use an open source license for specifications, people implementing those specifications may be doing so without the meaningfull copyright or patent grants that you expect.

A second difference is that common open source software and specification licenses tend to have different coverage scopes for the intellectual property terms. Open source licenses generally grant terms scoped only to a contributor's contributions. Specification licenses, however, generally cover implementations of the entire specification, regardless of who made the actual contribution. Because the specification will often be developed with contributions from multiple organizations, the various contributing organizations will often want to review and approve the full specification before extending intellectual property commitments to the final, combined result. 

## Who developed the Community Specification

The Community Specification has been developed via the [Joint Development Foundation](http://www.jointdevelopment.org), with inspiration from the [Open Web Foundation agreements](http://openwebfoundation.org) and the [Alliance for Open Media Patent License  1.0](http://aomedia.org/license/patent-license/).
